## Summary

This first scenario will cover some super simple basics of Git:

* How to configure the Git client
* How to create a Git repository
* How to share a Git repository
* How to create branches
* How to merge changes
* How to create tags

## Prerequisites

For this course you will need to create a [GitHub account][1], if you haven't one already.

I recommend to [create and use personal access token][2] for this course instead of your password, since this course and the terminal you are going to use is hosted on the internet.

Using a token instead of your accounts password has several benefits: You can delete the token afterwards, and you can restrict access with tokens to repositories and other functionalities of GitHub. So if the token is compromised the damage to your account is kept to a minimum.

Well, depends on the permissions you assign to the token.
